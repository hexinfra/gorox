This directory holds commands and tools, basically one cmd per directory.
By default there are 4 cmds:

  derox/
  goben/
  gocmc/
  gorox/

To add a new cmd named "foo":

  1. Create a folder called "foo" inside this directory,
  2. Place your go files in it.

To build cmds, use "gomake", like:

  shell> go build cmds/gomake.go
  shell> ./gomake foo
  shell> ./gomake all

By default, gomake builds gorox.
