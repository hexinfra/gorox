This directory holds your web applications in gorox, generally one app one
directory, but many related apps can be grouped into a container directory.

Some builtin apps are:

  examples/hello/    - An example "hello, world" app.
  examples/blog/     - An example blog app.
  examples/forum/    - An example forum app.
  fallback/          - A static app. Can be used as default app of http servers.

To add a new static app named "foo":

  1. Create a folder called "foo" in this directory,
  2. Create its config file "foo/app.conf" and configure it correctly,
  3. Add app "foo" in "../conf/gorox.conf" and link it to your http servers.

To add a new Go app named "bar":

  1. Create a folder called "bar" in this directory,
  2. Create its config file "bar/app.conf" and configure it correctly,
  3. Create Go file "bar/app.go" with initial code,
  4. Import package "bar" in "import.go",
  5. Add app "bar" in "../conf/gorox.conf" and link it to your http servers.

In gorox, an http server (like httpxServer and http3Server) can host many apps,
whereas an app can be linked to many http servers.

For examples, see builtin apps.
