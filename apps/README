This directory holds your Web applications in gorox, generally one app one
directory, but many related apps can be grouped into a container directory.

Some builtin apps are:

  examples/hello/    - An example "hello, world" app.
  examples/blog/     - An example blog app.
  examples/forum/    - An example forum app.
  fallback/          - A static app. Can be used as default app of web servers.

To add a new static app named "foo":

  1. Create a folder called "foo" in this directory,
  2. Create its config file "foo/app.conf" and configure it correctly,
  3. Add app "foo" in "../conf/gorox.conf" and link it to your web servers.

To add a new Go app named "bar":

  1. Create a folder called "bar" in this directory,
  2. Create its config file "bar/app.conf" and configure it correctly,
  3. Create Go file "bar/app.go" with initial code,
  4. Import package "bar" in "import.go",
  5. Add app "bar" in "../conf/gorox.conf" and link it to your web servers.

In gorox, a web server (like httpxServer, http3Server, and hwebServer) can host
many apps, whereas an app can be linked to many web servers.

For examples, see builtin apps.
