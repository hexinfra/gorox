This directory holds web applications in gorox, generally one app one directory.
Some builtin apps are:

  examples/hello/    - An example "hello, world" app.
  examples/blog/     - An example blog app.
  examples/forum/    - An example forum app.
  official/en_us/    - The official Gorox website in en_US.
  official/zh_cn/    - The official Gorox website in zh_CN.
  welcome/           - A static welcome app that can be used as a default app.

To add a new app named "foo":

  1. Create a folder called "foo" in this directory,
  2. Create its config file "foo/app.conf" and configure it correctly,
  3. Create Go file "foo/app.go" with initial code if it is not a static app,
  4. Import package "foo" in "import.go" if it is not a static app,
  5. Add app "foo" in "../conf/gorox.conf" and link it to your http servers.

In gorox, an http server (like httpxServer and http3Server) can host many apps,
whereas an app can be linked to many http servers.

For examples, see "examples/hello/" and "welcome/".
