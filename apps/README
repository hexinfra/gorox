This directory holds web applications of gorox, basically one app per directory.
Default apps are:

  examples/hello/    - An example app.
  official/en_us/    - The official Gorox website in en_US.
  official/zh_cn/    - The official Gorox website in zh_CN.
  welcome/           - A static app that can be used as a default app.

To add a new app named "foo":

  1. Create a folder called "foo" inside this directory,
  2. Create its config file "foo/app.conf",
  3. Create Go file "foo/app.go" if it is not a static app,
  4. Import package "foo" in "import.go" if it is not a static app,
  5. Add your app "foo" in "../conf/gorox.conf".

In gorox, an http server (like httpxServer and http3Server) can host many apps,
whereas an app can be bound to many http servers.

For examples, see "examples/hello/" and "welcome/".
