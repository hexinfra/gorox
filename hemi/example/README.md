Example
=======

In this directory, we place some example programs showing how to use the Hemi
Engine. These examples have their own "go.mod" and ".gitignore", so can be move
to anywhere you like, they don't depend on the "hemi/" directory they are in
because they use the dependency what their "go.mod" specified.
