This directory holds auxiliary commands, basically one cmd per directory.
By default there are 2 cmds:

  goben/    - An HTTP benchmarking tool.
  goops/    - Gorox Operation Server.

To add a new cmd named "foo":

  1. Create a folder called "foo" inside this directory,
  2. Place your go files in it.

To build cmd "foo", use "gomake", like:

  shell> go build cmds/gomake.go
  shell> ./gomake foo

To build all cmds, use:

  shell> ./gomake all

By default, gomake builds gorox:

  shell> ./gomake

Move gomake to your $PATH if you like.
