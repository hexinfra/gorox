This directory holds commands and tools, basically one cmd per directory.
By default there are 4 cmds:

  goben/    - An HTTP benchmarking tool.
  gocmc/    - Gorox Cluster Management Center/Console.
  godev/    - Used to develop hemi.
  gorox/    - The gorox server and control agent.

To add a new cmd named "foo":

  1. Create a folder called "foo" inside this directory,
  2. Place your go files in it.

To build cmds, use "gomake", like:

  shell> go build cmds/gomake.go
  shell> ./gomake foo
  shell> ./gomake all

By default, gomake builds gorox.
